From left to right, pass as many parameters as will fit in registers:

integers and pointers:

    RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, R9.

floating-point: xmm0, xmm1, xmm2, xmm3, xmm4, xmm5, xmm6, xmm7.

-- The stack pointer rsp must be aligned to a 16-byte boundary before making a call. You have to make that extra space yourself, by pushing something or subtracting 8 from rsp.
the calle-save registers are:

     RBP, RBX, R12, R13, R14, R15.

All others are free to be changed by the called function.
The callee is also supposed to save the control bits of the XMCSR and the x87 control word, but x87 instructions are rare in 64-bit code so you probably donâ€™t have to worry about this.

Integers are returned in rax or rdx:rax, and floating point values are returned in xmm0 or xmm1:xmm0.
